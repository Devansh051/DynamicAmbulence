## Dynamic Ambulance Dispatch System (DADS)

This project is a Dynamic Ambulance Dispatch System designed to efficiently allocate ambulance resources during emergencies and facilitate patient admissions to hospitals based on various factors such as casualties, road conditions, and patient details.

The main objectives of this system are:

1. Emergency Response Optimization: To swiftly identify the nearest hospital to an emergency location, considering factors like road conditions and casualties.

2. Patient Admission Management: To manage patient admissions to hospitals based on their proximity, available resources, and severity of their condition.

3. Efficient Resource Allocation: To optimize the allocation of ambulance resources by determining the shortest routes and optimal hospitals for patient treatment.

4. Data Management: To maintain a record of patient details, including their name, age, medical history, and contact information, for effective communication and follow-up.

5. User Interface: To provide a user-friendly interface for emergency responders to input emergency details, select hospitals, and manage patient admissions.

The system utilizes graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall to calculate shortest paths and optimal routes between emergency locations and hospitals. It also employs linked lists and file I/O operations for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Overall, this project aims to enhance emergency response efficiency and improve patient care by leveraging technology to streamline ambulance dispatch and hospital admissions processes.
